			<h2><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
			<p>3d Ant Attack is one of the most fondly remembered games from the early 1980s. Its unique and seminal graphical style, fascinating cityscape and the freedom that it offered to the player all broke new ground when it was released in 1983. Its place in the pantheon of truly classic computer games is richly deserved.</p>
			<p>This is a remake of the ZX Spectrum original, with graphics and sound both updated into true 3d. The essential game play is largely unchanged, however, and causing mayhem in the City of Antescher is as much fun now as it was 25 years ago.</p>

			<h2><a id="game"></a>The Game</h2>
			<p>The Walled City of Antescher has rested for a thousand, thousand years in the midst of the Great Desert, inhabited only by the deadly Ants who have made it their home.</p>
			<p>The sands have piled up at the walls but for some reason have never encroached upon the City itself. The City rests, dreaming of past glories, solid and unmoving; the signature of a long dead race. The City washed clean by the sun's rays. The City lost from the world of men for days without number.</p>
			<p>Then, one day, one year, one hour, He arrived and She arrived. Some say that they are descended from a race of wizards; some say that they are descended from a race hidden in a green valley at the North Pole. Who can really tell these days, how much we really know about the world as it was, or as it is, after so long in the cold Dark Ages? Only Antescher seems to stand inviolate after all this time, teeming with secrets, yet silent.</p>
			<p>He and She arrived to play their games through the wind-swept streets, ousting the ants from their exclusive occupation. He and She are now wreaking havoc through the ants who, for their part, kill and kill again without thought or consideration, just carrying out a biological imperative. He and She run to and fro, climbing in and out of the buildings, the sound of their feet stretching from block to block. They laugh and cry out in fear, walking with each other just ahead of the Ants and Death.</p>
			<p>And above all the drama within its walls, the City of Antescher watches and watches, waiting for the next renaissance and the next Golden Age. The City seems to have a presence, a huge brooding entity that hangs over the buildings, and which in some mysterious way controls the destiny of those below...</p>

			<h2><a id="controls"></a>Controls</h2>
			<p>The game is played with both mouse and keyboard. The mouse is used to change the orientation of the rescuer, while the keyboard is used to move. The keys are:</p>

			<h2><a id="differences"></a>Differences between the original and the remake</h2>
			<p>There are a few differences in gameplay between the ZX Spectrum original and this remake:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the original game, either human was knocked unconcious for a few seconds if they fell too far, whereas in the remake this penalty has been removed. This is to encourage exploration of the city without fear of falling. Also, since the ants are more aggressive in the remake, they would swiftly kill either human if they remained motionless for long.</li>
				<li>In both versions, the humans can run slightly faster than the ants. However, because of this, in the original game it was too easy to escape the ants and reach the exit without being challenged. To overcome this deficiency, the remake introduces a stamina meter for each human. Each human's stamina meter decreases as they run, and this in turn affects their maximum speed. Resting or walking allows the stamina meter to recover. This change makes the flight back to the exit much more challenging and strategic, since a route must be planned that allows brief pauses on buildings to recuperate.</li>
				<li>In the original game, an ever-present indicator showed the direction in which the rescuee lay. To be more challenging, in the remake this is replaced by heart-shaped beacons that the rescuee periodically emits while they are awaiting rescue.</li>
				<li>The artificial intelligence of the ants is naturally more sophisticated in the remake. Apart from using their sense of sight, ants can also smell and hear the humans, and work together to hunt them down. The ants become more alert once they have sensed a human, but in their initial state they are quite inattentive and can be avoided with care and stealth.</li>
				<li>The position of the sun, shadows and adjustable fog levels naturally change the gameplay for both the humans and the ants. As night falls, the ants' sense of sight weakens and provides the player with further opportunities to ghost through the city undetected. Furthermore, humans are less likely to be noticed if they are standing in the shadows.</li>
				<li>Both humans can drown if they are submerged in water for long enough. If a human is submerged, an oxygen meter appears below the stamina meter and will continue to decrease until the human emerges from the water.</li>

			<h2><a id="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
			<p>Ant Attack and the Map Maker should run on any version of Windows released since Windows 95, providing that OpenGL v1.2 is installed. In practice, any computer that has been used to play 3d games made since 2001 should be able to run Ant Attack without any difficulties. However, please refer to the following guide if you experience any of the following symptoms while trying to play Ant Attack:</p>
			<table border="1" cellpadding="16" cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<td class="centre"><h3>Symptom</h3></td>
					<td class="centre"><h3>Remedy</h3></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>You receive the message:<br>"Ant Attack requires Open GL v1.2 or later to be installed on your computer. Later versions of Open GL are often available with the latest drivers for your graphics card."</td>
					<td>Ensure that you have the most up-to-date graphics drivers installed on your computer.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>You receive one of these messages:<br>"Hardware acceleration is not available on the selected OpenGL Rendering Context. Please ensure that your video drivers are up-to-date."<br>"Unable To Create a Suitable Rendering Device."</td>
					<td>Ensure that you have the most up-to-date graphics drivers installed on your computer. If you have, then try reducing the "Colour Depth" and "Z-Buffer Depth" using the Configuration Manager.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>No ground is displayed.</td>
					<td>Use the Configuration Manager to disable "Per-Pixel Fog".</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>No sound effects are heard.</td>
					<td>Ensure that <code>openal32.dll</code> and <code>wrap_oal.dll</code> are both present in the same folder as <code>antattack.exe</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>You receive the message:<br>"Unable to locate resource.dat".</td>
					<td>Ensure that <code>resource.dat</code> is in the same folder as <code>antattack.exe</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>The game runs very slowly</td>
					<td>Firstly, ensure that you have the most up-to-date graphics drivers installed on your computer. Secondly, try reducing the size of the window by running the Configuration tool. As a benchmark, Ant Attack was developed on a computer with a 1.6Ghz processor and 1Gb RAM, with an ATI Radeon 9600 graphics card, and ran smoothly at a resolution of 1680 x 1050.</td>

			<h2><a id="credits"></a>Credits</h2>
			<p>The Ant Attack remake was born out of the Map Maker that was originally started in 1999. However, the majority of the game development occurred during July 2007, December 2007, and February 2008.</p>
